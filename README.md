tkspellcheck
============

A Tkinter Text Widget that uses PyEnchant as an in-line spell check.

Written for [nvPY](https://github.com/cpbotha/nvpy), a cross-platform SimpleNote client.

I'm currently testing, although with good results. But for that reason, it's rather limited in its usefulness at the moment.

If you'd like to see it in action, you'll need:

- Python 2 (Tested on 2.7.4)
- [PyEnchant](http://pythonhosted.org/pyenchant/) (Tested 1.6.5)

$ git clone https://github.com/bencorman/tkspellcheck.git
$ python tkspellcheck_example.py

==========

This is both my first github project and my first open source python application. So comments / suggestions / advice is both welcome and greatly appreciated.
